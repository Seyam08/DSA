Problem - Given a sorted array of 'n' elements and a target element 't', find the index of 't' in the
array. Return -1 if the target element is not found.
arr[-5, 2, 4, 6, 10], t = 10 -> Should return 4
arr = [-5, 2, 4, 6, 10], t = 6 -> Should return 3
arr = [-5, 2, 4, 6, 10], t = 20 -> Should return -1
