Climbing staircase Problem - Given a staircase of 'n' steps, count the number of distinct ways to climb to the top. 
You can either climb 1 step or 2 steps at a time. 
n=1, climbingStaircase(1) = 1 | (1) 
n=2, climbingStaircase(2) = 2 | (1, 1) and (2) 
n=3, climbingStaircase(3) = 3 | (1,1,1) (1, 2) and (2, 1) 
n=4, climbingStaircase(4) = 5 | (1,1,1,1) (1,1,2) (1,2,1) (2,1,1) and (2,2)
