Recursive Fibonacci sequence
Problem - Give a number 'n', find the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence
In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the
two preceding ones.
The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1. (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...)
A
recursiveFibonacci(0) = 0
recursiveFibonacci(1) = 1
recursive Fibonacci(6) = 8



Recursive Fibonacci sequence contd.
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding
ones.
If F represents a function to calculate the Fibonacci number, then
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
F = 0 and F1 = 1
F₂ = F₁ 1 + Fo
F₂ = 1+0
2
F₂ = 1
